# Ray tracer library for Android

![alt text](Example.gif)

## TODO

### Main tasks

* Give out of memory error when the memory is not enough to load the scene
* Use library to read texture images
* Implement loading of textures
* Rewrite code in a data oriented design
* Rewrite data structures in order to take advantage of **cache spatial / temporal locality**

### Possible Optimizing tasks

* Change all methods of classes to functions that receive an object
* Take advantage of OpenGL ES fragment shader in order to make a realtime ray tracer
